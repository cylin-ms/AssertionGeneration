Upload revised doc to `EngineeringDocuments/Plans` & notify group in Teams. |\n| 18:30 | **Metrics Visualization Prep** | Markita | Prepare two Grafana panels: (1) total thrash warnings, (2) breakdown by `cache_size` label; update slides. |\n| 17:00 | **Environment Validation for Demo** | Emory | Ensure Vault JWKS simulation returns expected values; check Jenkinsfile hooks in feature branch. |\n| 15:00 | **Attendee Prep Reminder** | Shakia | Send Teams message reminding all to review `JWT_Cache_Integration_Test_Plan.docx`, bring sample test snippets.

entity, he’s already shared in both docs.\n- Any PR/testing status pulled from Teams chat before meeting.\n\n---\n\n### 🚩 Risks & Notes\n- Timeline is compressed; almost everything must be done **today**.\n- Redirect non-critical prep (like runbook drafting) until after meeting → treat this session as discovery and decision-making.\n- If attendees suggest adding others last minute, logistics buffer is minimal; ensure Teams link OK.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Summary Action Highlights\n- **Today:** Review postmortem content, extract discussion points, check alert PR progress, send pre-read email, confirm file access.\n- **Tomorrow:** Final quick review of new updates, join call early, have materials in front of you.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to **generate a ready-to-send pre-read email** now

Review header override and rate-limit scenarios  \n  2. Define invalid `userId` and missing credential tests  \n  3. Outline JSON payload boundary conditions  \n  4. Determine required OpenAPI schema updates and mock server scripts  \n  5.

Plan must front-load critical actions and cut non-essentials.  \nPre-reads/distribution should happen early AM PDT.\n\n---\n\n## 🔄 **Workback Plan**\nWorking backward from **2025-07-23 16:00 PDT**, here is a practical timeline:\n\n---\n\n### **FINALIZATION PHASE**  \n**T-0 (16:00 PDT)** — **Meeting: Canary Postmortem Pre-Review** *(all tasks below must complete before this time)*\n\n**T-1 hr (15:00 PDT)**  \n- **Task:** Validate Teams link & audio/video setup  \n- **Owner:** Wilford  \n- **Notes:** Test screen-share; ensure canary metrics & Jenkins dashboard are open in tabs.  \n\n**T-2 hrs (14:00 PDT)**  \n- **Task:** Prepare dashboards for live review  \n- **Owner:** Wilford  \n- **Notes:** Load production canary results + staging graphs; confirm last ingestion cycle complete.  \n\n**T-3 hrs (13:00 PDT)**  \n- **Task:** Confirm alert threshold proposals are ready  \n- **Owner:** Sau (Platform Lead)  \n- **Notes:** Pull latest Jira tickets (if any exist) or draft thresholds table into doc for visibility.  \n\n---\n\n### **PREPARATION PHASE (Morning PDT)**  \n**T-5 hrs (11:00 PDT)**  \n- **Task:** Share Pre-Read Pack in Teams channel & via meeting chat  \n- **Owner:** Wilford  \n- **Includes:**  \n   - Current canary metrics snapshot  \n   - Draft alert thresholds (ask Sau to attach if complete)  \n   - Jenkins check log summary  \n   - Runbook update outline (if available)  \n- **Risk:** If thresholds/runbook not final, share as “working draft”  \n\n**T-6 hrs (10:00 PDT)**  \n- **Task:** Sync with QA (Bev & Myles)  \n- **Owner:** Wilford  \n- **Purpose:** Confirm any anomalies/trends in staging vs prod metrics and flag top 2 issues for discussion.  \n\n**T-7 hrs (09:00 PDT)** *(Now)*  \n- **Task:** Finalize meeting framing post in Teams  \n- **Owner:** Wilford  \n- **Notes:** Summarize objectives (as per agenda) and expectations:  \n  - “This is a **pre-review**, not deep-dive RCA. Goal: Align on data and fixes pipeline.”  \n\n---\n\n### **DEPENDENCIES**\n- Sau must supply threshold draft before Wilford can compile Pre-Read Pack.  \n- Jenkins logs expected to already be collected; if not, assign Danille for quick pull.  \n- If any blockers, escalate early to Saturnina (Director) for prioritization.\n\n---\n\n## 🔎 **Assumptions**\n- All attendees have Teams and can join; no physical venue needed.  \n- Pre-reading time will be minimal due to short window; call out key items in chat.  \n- If anyone is OOO or can’t prep fully, note contingency: focus meeting on critical blockers.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Condensed Workback Table\n\n| Time (PDT) | Task                                          | Owner    | Notes |\n|------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------|-------|\n| 09:00      | Post meeting objectives & framing in Teams   | Wilford | Emphasize purpose & agenda |\n| 10:00      | Quick sync with QA on staging anomalies      | Wilford | Bev & Myles;

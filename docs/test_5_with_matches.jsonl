High priority since leads into core agenda. |\n| 21:00 | **Finalize Slides & Agenda** | Shakia | Validate that all agenda points (Vault setup, Prometheus metrics, Jenkinsfile updates) are covered; include a Q&A placeholder. |\n| 20:00 | **Update Integration Test Plan with labeled metrics** | Rufina | Based on chat (14:12 UTC), add section for gauge label presence verification. Upload revised doc to `EngineeringDocuments/Plans` & notify group in Teams. |\n| 18:30 | **Metrics Visualization Prep** | Markita | Prepare two Grafana panels: (1) total thrash warnings, (2) breakdown by `cache_size` label; update slides. |\n| 17:00 | **Environment Validation for Demo** | Emory | Ensure Vault JWKS simulation returns expected values; check Jenkinsfile hooks in feature branch. |\n| 15:00 | **Attendee Prep Reminder** | Shakia | Send Teams message reminding all to review `JWT_Cache_Integration_Test_Plan.docx`, bring sample test snippets.
